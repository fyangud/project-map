### Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ This project map is a legacy version of my portfolio. It shows my selected design projects on a world map .

### The map has an extra layer of city lights, reflecting how those design projects are attracted to the population centers.

### By using javascript plugins, the site allows you to explore project details by zooming in /out, which is a relatively smooth interaction experience.

### You may visit the [project map](https://fyangud.github.io/project-map) here.
